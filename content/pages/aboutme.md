Title: About Me
Date: 2017-07-01 10:02

Hi, Iâ€™m Faisal Animashaun, a recent graduate of Georgia Tech. I enjoy every
aspect of computer science, from the theoretical to the practical. However, I
really like developing applications that delight the end user.

Consequently,
Iâ€™m really into frontend development. I spend far too much time on Hacker News
and elsewhere reading about the latest frameworks, tools, and paradigms. Ask me
about [insert yet another javascript framework that reinvents the wheel here]
and chances are I have heard about it. You can get in touch with me at
**d.f.animashaun --> gmail.com.**
